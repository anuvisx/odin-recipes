        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Making homemade pizza dough can sound like a lot of work, but it’s so worth the bragging rights. The dough itself requires few ingredients and just a little bit of rising and rest time. While you wait for the dough to be ready, you can get to work prepping your tomato sauce, chopping fresh vegetables, or grating the cheese you’ll put on top. Bake for 15 minutes, garnish with basil (or, let’s be real, more cheese), and enjoy showing off your way-better-than-takeout creation.</p>
        <h3>ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ cups warm water (600 mL)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>“Bloom” the yeast by sprinkling the sugar and yeast in the warm water. Let sit for 10 minutes, until bubbles form on the surface.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the middle and add the olive oil and bloomed yeast mixture. Using a spoon, mix until a shaggy dough begins to form.</li>
            <li>Once the flour is mostly hydrated, turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead for 10-15 minutes. The dough should be soft, smooth, and bouncy. Form the dough into a taut round.</li>
        </ol>
