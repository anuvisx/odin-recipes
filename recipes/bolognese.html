        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>It doesn’t take a lot of ingredients (or a lot of money) to make a classic Bolognese recipe. What it does take, though, is patience for the sauce to achieve the ideal authentic texture. You’re going to go low and slow—it’ll take around 3 hours, but most of that cook time is hands-off. </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 celery stalk, chopped</li>
            <li>1 small carrot, peeled, chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pulse onion, celery, and carrot in a food processor until very finely chopped. Transfer to a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a Dutch oven or other large pot over medium. Break beef into small clumps (about 1½") and add to pot; season lightly with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally but not breaking meat apart, until beef is lightly browned but not crisp, 6–8 minutes. It may be gray in spots (that’s okay!) and still a little pink in the center. Using a slotted spoon, transfer beef to a medium bowl.</li>
        </ol>
