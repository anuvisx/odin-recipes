        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>John Chandler's famous lasagna is truly "The World's Best." Since it was posted 22 years ago, this top-rated recipe has taken on a life of its own: John and his lasagna have been featured in The Washington Post and on Good Morning America. Community members love it for its relative ease, its basic ingredients, and its adaptability (reviewers love to share how they tweaked the recipe to make it their own). Unfortunately, John unexpectedly passed away earlier this year â€” read all about his life and legacy here. </p>
